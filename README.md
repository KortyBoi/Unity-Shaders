 Various Shaders I've made for Unity

## UI
This shader has a custom UI format to better organize the list of options you can use in unity.

## Compatibility
These shaders were tested to work in Unity 2017.4.x and 2018.4.x and 2019.x
These shaders were tested on different platforms, this works on PC builds and Android (mobile) builds and Linux and Mac (Mono) builds.
The only Shader that may have issues is: **Visual Effects** - on _Android_ (untested though)
